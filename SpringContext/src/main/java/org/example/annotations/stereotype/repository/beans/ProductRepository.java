/**
 * The @Repository annotation is a specialization of @Component, used specifically for DAO (Data Access Object) classes.
 *
 * - It marks this class as a Spring-managed bean that handles data persistence and retrieval.
 * - This annotation provides additional benefits such as exception translation, where Spring automatically converts
 *   database-related exceptions (e.g., SQLException) into Springâ€™s DataAccessException, making error handling uniform.
 * - Although functionally similar to @Component, @Repository is intended to clearly indicate that this class
 *   interacts with a database or other data sources.
 * - It is typically used in the persistence layer of an application to abstract away database operations.
